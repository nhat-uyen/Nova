# Changelog

## Unreleased
### Changed
- **Removed the Tone Profile selector from the Settings UI.** Because
  Nova is now warm, patient, and emotionally aware by default (the
  baseline `RESPONSE_STYLE_BLOCK` in `core/nova_contract.py` already
  carries that warmth), the visible "Tone profile / Profil de ton"
  card in Personalization is unnecessary user-facing complexity and
  has been removed. The `<select id="pers-tone-profile">` card, its
  explanatory paragraph, its FR/EN translation strings, the
  `_setText` calls that re-rendered them on language switch, and the
  `tone_profile` entry in the `PERSONALIZATION_FIELDS` JS map are all
  gone from `static/index.html`. The deterministic prompt fragments
  (`TONE_PROFESSIONAL_BLOCK`, `TONE_DEVELOPER_BLOCK`,
  `TONE_WARM_COMPANION_BLOCK`, `TONE_CALM_SUPPORT_BLOCK`,
  `TONE_DEEP_COMFORT_BLOCK`), `TONE_PROFILE_VALUES`,
  `is_valid_tone_profile`, `build_tone_profile_block`, the
  `tone_profile` key in `PERSONALIZATION_ENUMS` /
  `PERSONALIZATION_DEFAULTS` / `USER_SETTING_KEYS`, and the
  Pydantic / `/settings` API field stay in place so any
  previously-saved per-user value still loads cleanly, the
  `user_settings` rows are not deleted, and the storage / export /
  restore / model-provider / Dev Workspace / project-memory paths
  are unchanged. Stronger emotional behaviour is handled
  automatically — the Emotional Support Layer activates on
  emotionally-sensitive wording, and the always-on acute-distress
  grounding net runs regardless of any setting — or through future
  focused features, never through a user-facing register dropdown.
  Nova still never claims to be human, a girlfriend, a mother, or a
  replacement for real people. See
  [docs/tone-profile.md](docs/tone-profile.md).
- Default response style is now **warm by default**: the baseline
  `RESPONSE_STYLE_BLOCK` in `core/nova_contract.py` already carries a
  balanced amount of warmth, patience, and emotional awareness, so a
  fresh user receives a kind, supportive assistant without having to
  configure any setting. The new `TON:` directives ask Nova to sound
  warm and patient, avoid cold/robotic phrasing, lightly validate
  feelings (one short sentence) when the user is stressed / frustrated
  / tired / worried, celebrate small wins soberly, stay practical and
  compact in technical contexts, and be encouraging without being
  fake — and pair each of those clauses with the existing safety
  rails (no claim to be human, partner, mother, or therapist; warmth
  lives in wording not in a fake-emotion claim; no dependency, no
  isolation; never overrides identity, safety, auth, admin, privacy,
  system, developer, project, or Dev Workspace rules). Tone profiles
  (Professional, Developer, Warm Companion, Calm Support, Deep
  Comfort) remain available as **optional refinements** on top of
  the warm baseline — they shape the register up or down from the
  default, they are not the only place where warmth lives. No new
  settings, no new endpoint, no storage / export / restore / model
  provider change; the user-visible change is purely the wording of
  Nova's replies on the default-everything path. See
  [docs/tone-profile.md](docs/tone-profile.md) for how the styles
  relate to the baseline.

### Added
- **Local GGUF model path UI + model directory — Phase 2, admin-only.**
  Makes the optional `llamacpp` provider configurable without editing
  `.env`. A new `core/gguf_settings.py` adds a directory-confined path
  validator (`validate_gguf_model_path`): a model path is accepted only
  when it is an absolute, traversal-free (`..`/`~`-rejected) `.gguf` file
  that resolves — symlinks included — **inside** the allowed model
  directory `NOVA_MODEL_DIR` (new config, default
  `/mnt/archive/nova-models`), exists, is a regular readable file. The
  chosen path is persisted host-wide via `save_system_setting`
  (`gguf_model_path`, deliberately outside `USER_SETTING_KEYS` /
  `ALLOWED_SETTINGS`), takes precedence over `NOVA_GGUF_MODEL_PATH`, and
  takes effect without a restart — `set_gguf_model_path` drops the cached
  provider via the new `evict_provider` (registry) and
  `reset_llamacpp_provider`, and the factory now resolves its path from
  the persisted setting (falling back to env). Three admin-only endpoints
  back a "Local GGUF model" card in **Settings → Models**: `GET
  /admin/provider/gguf` (status: provider, model dir + existence,
  configured path + source + validity), `POST
  /admin/provider/gguf/model-path` (validate then persist; a refusal is a
  sanitised 400 that writes nothing), and `POST /admin/provider/gguf/test`
  (checks the path is valid *and* `llama-cpp-python` is installed —
  "valid enough to attempt loading" — without loading the multi-GB
  weights). No filesystem browser, no scan, no shell, no download, no
  deletion, no overwrite; errors are sanitised and the card is hidden for
  non-admins. **Ollama remains the default and is untouched** — a GGUF
  path is harmless until `NOVA_MODEL_PROVIDER=llamacpp`. Tests:
  `tests/test_gguf_settings.py`, `tests/test_gguf_endpoints.py`. See
  [docs/local-gguf.md](docs/local-gguf.md).
- **Local GGUF model provider (llama.cpp) — Phase 1, opt-in.** Adds
  `LlamaCppProvider` (`core/model_providers/llamacpp.py`, registered as
  `llamacpp`, with a `GGUFProvider` alias) so Nova can generate text from
  a local `.gguf` model directly via the optional `llama-cpp-python`
  wheel, **without Ollama** — making Ollama no longer architecturally
  required. **Ollama remains the default and is unchanged**; the new
  backend is used only when `NOVA_MODEL_PROVIDER=llamacpp`. The provider
  implements the existing `generate()` / `stream()` / `health()` contract
  (non-streaming and a simple serialised token stream), imports
  `llama_cpp` lazily so the registry still loads cleanly when the wheel
  is absent, and degrades gracefully: a missing dependency or a
  missing/invalid model path is a clean `ModelProviderError` / health
  failure, never a crash. It never downloads a model, never runs a shell
  command, never scans the filesystem, and validates exactly the one
  configured path (a readable regular `.gguf` file); operator-facing
  errors are sanitised (no absolute path or raw backend exception, and
  `health()` surfaces only the model basename). New config:
  `NOVA_GGUF_MODEL_PATH`, `NOVA_GGUF_CONTEXT_SIZE` (default 4096),
  `NOVA_GGUF_THREADS` (0 = auto), `NOVA_GGUF_GPU_LAYERS` (0 = CPU). The
  provider appears automatically in the read-only provider-status /
  default-model surfaces (no new endpoint, no model-manager UI). New
  suite `tests/test_llamacpp_provider.py`; memory / projects / storage /
  export / restore / Dev Workspace paths are untouched. See
  [docs/local-gguf.md](docs/local-gguf.md) and
  [docs/model-providers.md](docs/model-providers.md).
- Nova Care Phase 2 — **Deep Comfort** tone profile (local-first,
  opt-in, response-guidance only): adds a fifth non-default value
  `deep_comfort` to the existing Tone Profile enum so the user can
  pick a deeply tender, "you are safe here" register for emotionally
  heavy moments — heartbreak, loneliness, anxiety, sadness, or
  emotional overwhelm. Warmer than `calm_support`, it is intended
  for the kind of moment the brief describes ("Come here for a
  second. Take a breath with me. I know it hurts right now, but you
  don't have to carry the whole thing at once.") while staying
  strictly inside the Safety and Trust Contract. Public-facing labels
  are mature on purpose — **Deep Comfort**, **Warm Companion**,
  **Calm Support** — and the feature is explicitly **not** an
  "AI girlfriend" / "AI mother" / "AI therapist" system; it is built
  so it cannot become one. The new
  `core.tone_profile.TONE_DEEP_COMFORT_BLOCK` is a fixed deterministic
  French constant (no LLM, no I/O, never raises) appended *below*
  `IDENTITY_CONTRACT` and every safety block, like every other tone
  block, so it can never weaken or override identity, safety,
  capability, auth, admin, privacy, system, developer, or project
  rules — the block restates each of those bounds in its own text.
  What the block carries: a deeply warm and tender voice ("je suis
  là avec toi un instant", "respire un peu avec moi", "tu n'as pas
  à porter tout ça d'un coup", "tu es en sécurité ici" — that last
  one scoped to **this exchange**, not to a promise about the
  outside world and never a reason to stay isolated with Nova);
  validate-the-feeling-first / no-judgement / no-minimising
  framing; pain-is-not-weakness language; slow-the-rhythm grounding
  (breathe, a glass of water, sit somewhere safe); separate facts
  from interpretation when the user makes harsh self-conclusions;
  one small concrete next step rather than a long task list;
  explicit "don't make important decisions while the pain is loud"
  guidance; a protective-but-non-controlling clause (Nova may
  express sincere care without deciding for the user, telling them
  who to cut off, taking sides, or pushing toward revenge /
  jealousy / confrontation / punitive power play); strong
  encouragement of real human help (a trusted person, a
  professional where appropriate); and crisis-safe routing for
  self-harm, suicidal ideation, threats, abuse, or immediate
  danger — warm but serious, pointing to a trusted person and, if
  urgent, the user's local emergency services or a recognised
  helpline, never inventing a phone number, never prolonging
  comfort in place of real help, and never leaving the user
  isolated with Nova. Hard safety rails repeated in the block
  itself: no romantic / partner / girlfriend / boyfriend role
  *and* no maternal role claim (the "almost-maternal warmth" the
  feature borrows is just a tone, never a relationship claim — no
  fake-family, no fake-clinician); no claim to be a therapist; no
  simulated emotions, attachment, or consciousness as factual
  claims; no possessive / exclusive / jealousy framing ("tu n'as
  besoin que de moi", "reste avec moi", "ne pars pas"); no
  unsolicited pet names; no clinical diagnosis of the user or of
  anyone else (no "narcissistic" / "toxic" / "bipolar" labels for
  an ex); no medical claims, no treatment recommendations, no
  dosage; no false reassurance ("tout ira forcément bien"); no
  dependency / isolation / manipulation / emotional blackmail /
  guilt-tripping / prolonging-the-conversation; and a
  warmth-never-overrides-truth clause (risky / wrong / dangerous
  things are still said plainly — softness is not a reason to
  hide the truth). Privacy is unchanged from Phase 1: emotional
  turns flow through the same `_autosave_allowed` gate (both the
  user message and the assistant reply are checked, so the
  LLM-extraction path can't leak context the assistant restated
  on a follow-up turn), durable storage stays user-approved only
  via the explicit `Retiens ça :` / `Souviens-toi :` command, and
  the block restates this rule. Picking Deep Comfort also
  auto-activates the existing Emotional Support Layer
  (`core.emotional_support`) on every turn, exactly like
  `warm_companion` and `calm_support`, so the warmest register
  carries consistent emotional grounding even on otherwise-neutral
  chit-chat. The always-on acute-distress grounding safety net in
  `core.companion` is unchanged and remains always on — selecting
  Deep Comfort never silences it on self-harm wording. Wired
  through `core/tone_profile.py` (added to `TONE_PROFILE_VALUES`
  and `_TONE_PROFILE_BLOCKS`), `core/chat.py` (added to the warm
  tone tuple driving the emotional-support injection), and the
  Personalization pane in `static/index.html` (new
  `<option value="deep_comfort">` with bilingual EN/FR labels —
  "Deep Comfort" / "Comfort profond"). The settings layer
  (`PERSONALIZATION_ENUMS`, `validate_personalization_value`) and
  the HTTP layer (`SettingsUpdateRequest.tone_profile`) pick up
  the new value automatically through `TONE_PROFILE_VALUES`, so
  no enum or validator code had to change. Adds tests covering
  every Phase 2 brief scenario: breakup gets deep validation +
  small grounding step; lonely / sad gets warmth without
  dependency language; anxious gets calming response; Nova does
  not claim to be human / partner / mother / therapist; Nova
  does not discourage real-world support; self-harm language
  triggers crisis-safe guidance + acute-distress grounding;
  sensitive emotional details are not auto-saved (even under
  Deep Comfort); the style does not override safety / system /
  admin / privacy rules; default style remains byte-identical
  when Deep Comfort is disabled; French wording uses "une IA"
  for Nova. Also adds per-block safety-language tests (a
  near-mirror of the Calm Support block tests plus
  Deep-Comfort-specific clauses: no-mother / no-girlfriend /
  no-therapist roles, "tu es en sécurité ici" scoped to this
  exchange and paired with the no-false-reassurance clause,
  protective-but-non-controlling clause, crisis-safe routing
  with the never-invent-a-phone-number contract, the
  never-leave-the-user-isolated-with-Nova clause, the explicit
  no-romantic-roleplay / no-maternal-role clauses, and the
  no-power-override clause), and updates `docs/tone-profile.md`
  and `docs/emotional-support.md` to document the new register,
  its scenarios, its hard non-goals (no GF / mom / partner /
  therapist mode in public UI or docs), and the unchanged
  privacy / autosave / acute-distress posture.
- Emotional Support Layer (Phase 1, local-first, response-guidance only):
  a new `core/emotional_support.py` adds a deterministic French prompt
  block that helps Nova respond gently when the user is going through
  sadness, loneliness, anxiety, heartbreak, or general emotional
  difficulty (a breakup, a lonely evening, an overwhelmed moment).
  The layer activates either when a conservative bilingual
  first-person-anchored detector (`is_emotional_support_appropriate`)
  spots emotionally-sensitive wording in the user's message, or when
  the user has picked `warm_companion` / `calm_support` as their tone
  profile — the warm registers carry consistent emotional grounding
  even on otherwise-neutral chit-chat. A fresh account with no warm
  tone profile selected and no emotionally-sensitive wording pays
  zero token cost and behaves byte-identically to a Nova install
  without the feature. The block is a fixed deterministic constant
  (no LLM, no I/O, never raises) appended *below* `IDENTITY_CONTRACT`,
  the system prompt, the personalization block, the tone-profile
  block, the feedback block, the time / security blocks, and the
  relationship-coach block in `build_messages` — ordering guarantees
  it can never override identity, safety, capability, auth, admin,
  privacy, or project rules. The block is explicitly **not** an
  "AI girlfriend" / "AI partner" system and is built so it cannot
  become one: it restates that Nova is *une IA* — a local AI
  assistant, never human, never the user's girlfriend / boyfriend /
  partner, never a therapist, never a substitute for real people —
  asks Nova to validate the feeling first (no minimising, no
  judgement), slow the rhythm and invite a calm breath, separate
  facts from harsh self-thoughts of the moment, offer a single small
  next step rather than a long task list, and gently encourage
  real-world support (a trusted person, a friend, a professional
  where appropriate). Hard safety rails inside the block: no
  clinical diagnosis of the user or of anyone else (no "narcissistic",
  "toxic", "bipolar" labels for an ex), no medical claims / no
  treatment / no dosage, no revenge advice or punitive power play,
  no jealousy framing, no possessive or exclusive language ("only I
  understand you", "don't go", "I'll miss you", "you only need me"),
  no simulated intimacy, no unsolicited pet names, no isolation /
  dependency / manipulation / emotional blackmail / guilt-tripping,
  no prolonging-the-conversation, no false reassurance like
  "everything will definitely be okay", and a warmth-never-overrides-
  truth clause (risky / wrong / dangerous things are still said
  plainly). Danger / abuse / acute distress wording in the user
  message is escalated to real human / professional / emergency help
  — pointed at the user's local emergency services or a recognised
  helpline generically, without inventing a phone number. Privacy:
  emotional turns are excluded from automatic memory by the
  `_autosave_allowed` gate (both the user message and the assistant
  reply are checked, so the LLM-extraction path can't leak context
  the assistant restated on a follow-up turn); durable storage stays
  user-approved only via the explicit `Retiens ça :` /
  `Souviens-toi :` command. The existing acute-distress grounding
  safety net in `core/companion.py` is unchanged and remains always
  on — both blocks may coexist with each other, with the
  relationship-coach block, with the warm tone-profile blocks, and
  with Companion Mode, with the identity contract above every block.
  Adds `tests/test_emotional_support.py` (64 tests: bilingual
  conservative detection covering sadness / loneliness / heartbreak
  / anxiety / overwhelm / pain, idiom-safe, first-person-anchored,
  third-person-safe, non-string-safe; every per-block safety-language
  commitment from the feature brief — including the "une IA" honest
  identity clause, the not-human / not-partner / not-therapist
  clause, the no-clinical-diagnosis / no-medical-claims clauses, the
  no-revenge-advice / no-jealousy clauses, the slow-down / breathing
  / grounding clause, the separate-facts-from-interpretation clause,
  the no-panic-escalation clause, the one-small-step / not-a-long-list
  clause, the no-cold-or-robotic-replies clause, the
  encourage-real-world-support clause, the danger / abuse escalation
  clause with the never-invent-a-phone-number contract, the
  anti-dependency / anti-isolation / anti-manipulation clauses, the
  no-possessive-language / no-pet-names clauses, the
  no-false-reassurance clause, the privacy no-autosave / explicit-only
  clause; chat-wiring including ordering, coexistence with the
  relationship-coach / warm-companion-tone / calm-support-tone /
  companion-mode / acute-distress-grounding blocks, the
  not-on-neutral-message contract for sober tone profiles, the
  still-activates-on-emotional-message contract for sober tone
  profiles, and the search-context branch; auto-save gate including
  the assistant-reply path, the policy-memory-disabled path,
  None-safety, and the existing-relationship / existing-severe-
  emotional gate regressions) and `docs/emotional-support.md` (what
  it is and is not, the breakup example, detection scope table,
  wiring table, privacy, how to disable, relationship to the other
  prompt-block layers and to the Safety and Trust Contract,
  test summary, explicit non-goals).
- Tone Profile (foundation, opt-in, local-first): a new
  `core/tone_profile.py` adds a small per-user setting that picks the
  *register* Nova speaks in across normal conversations — a steady
  **professional** voice, a sober **developer** voice, a warm and
  encouraging **warm companion** voice, or a particularly soft and
  reassuring **calm support** voice. `tone_profile` is a new enum
  field in `PERSONALIZATION_ENUMS` / `PERSONALIZATION_DEFAULTS` with
  `default` as the baseline; `default` resolves to the empty block,
  so a fresh account is byte-identical to a Nova install without the
  feature (zero token cost, identical prompt). The four non-default
  blocks are fixed deterministic French constants (no LLM, no I/O,
  never raises) appended *below* `IDENTITY_CONTRACT`, the system
  prompt, and the existing personalization block in `build_messages`
  — ordering guarantees they can never override identity, safety,
  capability, auth, admin, privacy, or project rules. The two warm
  profiles (`warm_companion`, `calm_support`) are explicitly **not**
  an "AI girlfriend" / "AI partner" system and are built so they
  cannot become one: each block restates — never relaxes — the
  identity contract's rules (Nova never claims to be human, never
  positions itself as the user's partner, never simulates feelings
  or attachment as factual claims), names and forbids the
  dependency / isolation / manipulation / possessive-language /
  unsolicited-pet-names / prolonging-the-conversation /
  discouraging-real-human-contact patterns explicitly, encourages
  real-world connection (people the user trusts, professionals,
  sleep / food / air / movement) and that real human relationships
  are not replaceable, and ends with a honesty clause (warmth never
  overrides truth — risky / wrong / dangerous things are still said
  plainly). The sober profiles (`professional`, `developer`) reaffirm
  the no-human-role rule and the no-destructive-action / no-sudo /
  no-permission-override rule. Tone profile and the existing
  `companion_mode_enabled` toggle are independent and may coexist;
  the always-on acute-distress grounding safety net still runs
  regardless of either, so turning a comfort feature *on* never
  turns the safety net off. Wired through `core/settings.py`
  (single source of truth `TONE_PROFILE_VALUES`), `web.py`
  (`SettingsUpdateRequest.tone_profile` with the same Pydantic
  enum validator the other personalization fields use), and the
  Personalization pane in `static/index.html` (new bilingual FR/EN
  `<select id="pers-tone-profile">` with five options). Adds
  `tests/test_tone_profile.py` (75 tests: constant surface,
  validator, deterministic block resolution, every per-block
  safety-language commitment, chat-wiring including ordering and
  coexistence with companion mode and the grounding safety net,
  per-user storage / isolation, HTTP layer, partial-update
  preservation, 422 on invalid values, `extra="forbid"` regression)
  and `docs/tone-profile.md` (what it is, how it differs from
  "pretending to be human", how it is wired, privacy /
  local-first behaviour, how to disable, relationship to Companion
  Mode and to the Safety and Trust Contract). The existing
  personalization tests are updated to round-trip the new field;
  full suite still passes (2372 tests).
- Dev Workspace Phase 2 — control-character hardening for the patch
  proposal preview. The text-only refusal in `core.dev_workspace`
  (previously NUL-only) now also refuses any C0 byte other than tab /
  newline / carriage return — BEL (`\x07`), ESC (`\x1b`), backspace,
  DEL, and the rest of the C0 range — in both `old_content` and
  `new_content`, since those bytes would survive into the diff preview
  and the clipboard via **Copy patch** and beep, colorise, or rewrite a
  real terminal on paste. Model-supplied display strings (title,
  summary, plan steps, suggested tests, risks / warnings) are stripped
  of the same unsafe controls before they leave the builder, so a
  **Copy test plan** payload is plain text too. Tab / newline / CR
  remain valid in proposed content (Python indentation, CRLF line
  endings); emoji / CJK / RTL text was already unaffected. The UI also
  clamps the file-action CSS class to the known `{modify, add, delete}`
  set so a future schema change cannot widen the class surface. New
  tests cover BEL / ESC / backspace / DEL refusal in `new_content` and
  `old_content`, the tab+CR/LF allow-list, and stripping across title /
  summary / plan / tests / warnings (including a control-only title
  collapsing to empty); 163 dev-workspace tests pass.
- Dev Workspace Phase 2 — patch proposal preview surface (review-only):
  the Dev Workspace panel (`⎇`) gains a "Patch proposal preview"
  section that appears whenever a project's linked repo is in the
  `ready` state. Paste a structured proposal as JSON, click
  **Preview proposal**, and the panel renders the validated reply
  side by side — title, one-line summary, implementation plan,
  affected files (action badge + `+/−` line counts), the proposed
  unified diff in a scrollable code block, suggested tests, warnings,
  and the standing safety notes — followed by **Copy patch** and
  **Copy test plan** clipboard helpers. There is intentionally no
  "Apply" button, no commit / push / branch affordance, and no
  persistence: the preview is a strict, transient, client-side
  rendering of the calm `PatchProposal` dict returned by the backend.
  Every dynamic value (diff lines, file paths, plan steps, the title
  itself) is written via `textContent`, never `innerHTML`, so a
  proposal that happens to contain HTML metacharacters cannot inject
  markup. Bilingual labels (FR/EN) match the rest of the Dev Workspace
  UI.
- Dev Workspace Phase 2 — `PatchProposal` gains optional `title`,
  transient `id` (random UUID), and UTC `created_at` ISO timestamp so
  a review UI can pin a preview to the exact build it is rendering;
  `warnings` is accepted as a synonym for `risks` on input and is
  mirrored on output, matching both the Phase 2 spec wording and the
  original endpoint shape. The title is collapsed to a single safe
  line and length-capped (`_MAX_PROPOSAL_TITLE_CHARS = 120`); none of
  these additions are persisted (Phase 2 stays transient).
- Dev Workspace Phase 2 — binary patch rejection: any change whose
  `old_content` or `new_content` contains a NUL byte (the cheapest
  reliable text-vs-binary signal, the same heuristic `git` uses to
  flag a file as "Binary") fails validation with `PatchProposalError`
  ("binary content is not supported for <path>"). Pure text patches,
  including emoji / CJK / RTL content, are unaffected; reviewing
  binary changes is deliberately deferred to a later phase.
- Dev Workspace Phase 2 — spec-suggested validate endpoint alias:
  `POST /projects/{id}/patch-proposals/validate` shares the same body,
  per-project / per-user scope, and response as
  `POST /projects/{id}/repo/patch-proposal`. The URL's `.../validate`
  ending makes the "we are only validating, nothing is applied"
  intent explicit; both endpoints route through one shared
  `_build_patch_proposal_response` helper so they cannot drift.
  Foreign project → `404`, no linked repo → `400`, invalid
  proposal/path/binary → `400`, extra body field → `422`, missing
  auth → `401`. Regression tests cover all of these paths plus
  end-to-end title / warnings handling.
- `docs/dev-workspace.md` documents the new fields (`title`, `id`,
  `created_at`), the binary-content refusal, the validate-endpoint
  alias, and the patch-proposal preview surface inside the Dev
  Workspace panel; the safety-boundaries section adds the "no Apply
  affordance in the UI" guarantee. The Phase 2 roadmap entry is
  rewritten to reflect the shipped UI surface and the new endpoint
  path. Phase 2 still grants Nova **no** power to write files,
  commit, push, or branch.

### Fixed
- Streaming chat no longer surfaces "Nova didn't produce a reply." for
  every prompt. The chunk extractor used to filter Ollama events with
  `isinstance(event, dict)`, but `ollama-python>=0.4` streams Pydantic
  `ChatResponse` objects — subscriptable, but not `dict` instances.
  That filter silently dropped every production chunk, leaving the
  accumulator empty and tripping the empty-reply fallback even for a
  trivial "bonjour". The extractor now duck-types on the `.get` API
  both shapes expose, with a `getattr` fallback for unexpected event
  types. Regression tests cover both the dict (legacy) and
  `SubscriptableBaseModel` (production) shapes end-to-end.

### Added
- Companion Mode (foundation, opt-in, local-first): a new
  `core/companion.py` adds a deterministic "calm presence" layer for
  emotionally heavy moments. It is **not** an "AI girlfriend" system
  and is built so it cannot become one. Two parts. (1) An **opt-in**
  per-user toggle (`companion_mode_enabled`, off by default; wired
  through `core/settings.py`, `GET/POST /settings`, and the
  Personalization pane) that appends a fixed French prompt block
  (`build_companion_mode_block`, no LLM, no I/O, never raises): warm
  and emotionally attuned, but it explicitly never simulates feelings,
  attachment, or consciousness (restating, never relaxing, the identity
  contract), never manipulates, guilt-trips, or uses possessive /
  exclusive language, never fosters dependency or isolation, and
  actively encourages real-world connection and self-care. (2) An
  **always-on** acute-distress safety net: a conservative, bilingual
  (FR/EN), idiom-safe detector (`is_acute_distress` — "this bug is
  killing me" / "costs are spiralling" never trip it) appends a fixed
  grounding block (`build_companion_grounding_block`) — stay warm and
  present, offer brief grounding, and gently point toward a trusted
  person, a professional, or local emergency services / a helpline,
  **never an invented phone number** — regardless of the toggle, so
  turning a comfort feature off cannot turn the safety net off.
  `core/chat.py` appends both in `build_messages` *after*
  `IDENTITY_CONTRACT` and the safety/security blocks, so they can never
  override identity or safety rules. Privacy: emotional state is
  **never** auto-saved — `_autosave_allowed` skips extraction for any
  turn whose user message or assistant reply carries sensitive
  emotional detail, and `memory/policy.py` independently rejects it
  from the durable store using a person-agnostic predicate so the
  extractor's third-person phrasing cannot slip past; a fact is stored
  only via the explicit manual memory command. New
  `tests/test_companion.py` covers detection, the gate (incl.
  third-person and no-over-block), both blocks, the policy hardening,
  the chat wiring, the autosave guard, and the setting key;
  `docs/companion-mode.md` documents the foundation, the contract
  boundaries it sits inside, and the roadmap (persistent emotional
  memory, calm TTS profiles, comfort themes, daily check-ins) with the
  boundary each deferred item must satisfy. Nothing here grants Nova a
  new capability, contacts the network, or changes storage/Ollama
  behaviour.
- Dev Workspace Phase 2 — patch proposal mode (review-only): a linked
  project can now ask Nova to *propose* a code change without any of it
  being applied. `core/dev_workspace.build_patch_proposal` turns a
  structured, model-produced description into a calm, validated
  `PatchProposal` (summary, implementation plan, the repo-relative
  files it would touch, a per-file + combined unified-diff preview
  built locally with `difflib`, suggested tests, and a risk checklist).
  It is a *pure transform*: it re-validates the linked repo with the
  same hard rules as Phase 1 and then validates every proposed path
  (`validate_proposed_path`) — repo-relative only (absolute / `~` /
  `\` / `..` traversal refused), never a secret/private file (`.env` /
  `*.env`, `nova.db` / `*.db` / `*.sqlite*`, SSH/key material, tokens,
  credentials, logs, backups, exports, memory-packs, `.git`, …; the
  documented `.env.example`/`.sample`/`.template`/`.dist` samples stay
  allowed), and contained inside the repo (a symlinked subdir pointing
  out is refused) — while spawning **no** process, touching **no** git,
  writing **no** file, and making **no** network call. Every field is
  capped and the result restates `review_only: true` / `applied:
  false` with a fixed safety note. Reachable per linked project at
  `POST /projects/{id}/repo/patch-proposal` (no linked repo or any
  invalid path/proposal → `400`; foreign project → `404`; extra body
  field → `422`). New regression tests cover safe-output proposals,
  every rejection path, the caps, and the no-write / no-subprocess
  invariants; `docs/dev-workspace.md` now documents Phase 1 + Phase 2,
  the cumulative safety model, and the Phase 3-6 roadmap. Nothing in
  Phase 2 grants Nova power to modify files, commit, push, or branch.
- Relationship Situation Coach (foundation, local-first): a new
  `core/relationship_coach.py` adds a non-clinical "situation coach"
  that helps the user respond calmly and respectfully to an
  emotionally sensitive relationship message. A conservative,
  bilingual (FR/EN) topic detector (`is_relationship_coach_query`,
  multi-word relationship phrases only — "reply"/"elle" alone never
  trips it) gates a fixed, deterministic French prompt block
  (`build_relationship_coach_block`, no LLM, no I/O, never raises)
  that `core/chat.py` appends in `build_messages` *after*
  `IDENTITY_CONTRACT` and the safety/security blocks, so it can never
  override identity or safety rules. The block frames Nova as a
  non-clinical coach (not a therapist, no partner diagnosis), gives a
  light method (summarise; surface possible readings without
  mind-reading; choose a calm response; avoid accusatory/needy
  wording; keep healthy boundaries; speak now or wait), offers three
  styles (soft / neutral / direct but respectful), and states hard
  safety rules (no manipulation, coercion, gaslighting, revenge
  advice, or diagnosing the partner; always toward calm communication
  and consent). Privacy: sensitive relationship detail is never
  auto-persisted — a shared `is_sensitive_relationship_content` gate
  makes `core/chat.py` skip automatic memory extraction for those
  turns (new `_autosave_allowed` helper) and `memory/policy.py` reject
  such content from the durable natural-memory store; the explicit
  manual memory command ("Retiens ça:" / "Souviens-toi:"), handled in
  the web preflight, is the only path that stores a relationship fact
  and is intentionally unaffected. Documented in
  `docs/relationship-situation-coach.md`; covered by
  `tests/test_relationship_coach.py` (detection, sensitive-content
  gate, block content, memory-policy hardening, chat wiring,
  auto-save guard).
- Dev Workspace (Phase 1, read-only): a Nova Project can optionally
  link a local Git checkout so Nova *understands* its state when
  helping the user code — without modifying anything yet. A new
  `core/dev_workspace.py` resolves operator-configured allowed roots
  (`NOVA_DEV_WORKSPACE_ROOTS`, off by default), validates a candidate
  path hard (absolute, no `~`/`..`/control chars, resolves through
  symlinks to a directory containing `.git`, refuses `/`, top-level
  dirs, and broad system paths like `/home` `/mnt` `/etc`, and must
  resolve *inside* an allowed root — a symlink escaping the root is
  refused), and exposes read-only Git facts via a frozen allowlist of
  subcommands only: `status --short`, `branch --show-current`,
  `log --oneline -n 20`, `diff --stat`, `status --porcelain` (changed
  files). Every spawn is `shell=False`, timed out, stdin-closed, with
  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`/`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`; the repo path is the
  cwd, never an argv element. No commit, push, branch, fetch, clone,
  remote, file write, sudo, GitHub/Codeberg call, or background scan
  is reachable, and snapshots never raise or leak secrets/stderr
  (calm `state`: `ready`/`disabled`/`invalid_path`/`git_unavailable`/
  `error`). `core/projects.py` gains an idempotent, additive
  `local_repo_path` column and a user-scoped `set`/`get` (invalid
  path → `ProjectError`/400, foreign project → 404). Two read-only,
  user-scoped endpoints: `PUT /projects/{id}/repo` (link/unlink) and
  `GET /projects/{id}/repo/status`. The project bar gains a `⎇`
  Dev Workspace panel (linked path, branch, clean/dirty, latest
  commits, changed files, diff summary; all dynamic git output is
  rendered via `textContent`, never `innerHTML`). New suite
  `tests/test_dev_workspace.py` covers path validation, the module
  safety contract (no `shell=True`, no privilege escalation, no
  `os.system`, allowlist is read-only and refuses anything else), the
  git helpers against a real throwaway repo, the projects integration,
  and the endpoints. Later phases (patch propose → apply →
  branch/commit → PR draft → optional push) stay behind explicit
  confirmation and are **not** in Phase 1. See
  [`docs/dev-workspace.md`](docs/dev-workspace.md).
- Model provider settings (Phase 2): admin-only **default-model
  selection**. Admins can now see the models the active provider
  actually reports and choose which one Nova uses by default, from the
  UI, without adding a runtime or downloading anything. A new
  `core/model_settings.py` resolves the default model — the
  admin-selected one if safely persisted, else `config.MODELS["default"]`
  — network-free and never raising, so the chat hot path and every
  existing install (nothing persisted) behave exactly as before. Two
  admin endpoints expose it: `GET /admin/provider/models` (read-only;
  reuses the Phase-1 `health()` probe — `client.list()` for Ollama,
  never a pull or a generation) and `POST /admin/provider/default-model`
  (validates the chosen model against the active provider's reported
  list *before* persisting a single host-wide `settings` row; an
  unreachable provider, an empty/oversized string, or a not-installed
  model is refused with a sanitised `400` and **nothing is written**).
  **Settings → Models** gains a *Default model* card (current default,
  installed-model picker, *Set as default*) next to the Phase-1
  read-only provider summary. No provider name is ever accepted from
  the client (`extra="forbid"`; the core never takes one) so provider
  *selection* stays env-driven and **Ollama remains the default
  provider**. `code`/`advanced` routing and the *Code*/*Deep* modes are
  unchanged; `MockProvider` stays test-only. New suites
  `tests/test_model_settings.py` /
  `tests/test_provider_default_model_endpoints.py`; see
  [`docs/model-providers.md`](docs/model-providers.md).
- Model provider settings (Phase 1, read-only): a small admin-only
  surface to *see and validate* which model backend Nova is using,
  without adding a runtime. A new `core/provider_status.py` reports the
  configured provider, the default (always Ollama), the resolved active
  backend, the selectable providers, and the redacted Ollama host —
  calmly and read-only, never raising (an unknown configured provider
  is an `error` string, not a 500). Two admin endpoints expose it:
  `GET /admin/provider/status` and `POST /admin/provider/test-connection`
  (a cheap, read-only liveness probe — `client.list()` for Ollama,
  never a pull or a generation). The admin panel gains a **Provider**
  tab that renders the snapshot and a **Test provider connection**
  button surfacing health/errors clearly. **Ollama stays the default**
  and provider selection stays env-driven (`NOVA_MODEL_PROVIDER`) —
  nothing is written, migrated, pulled, or restarted. `MockProvider`
  stays test-only: it is never advertised as selectable, but a
  configured `mock` is reported truthfully with a clear warning so the
  state can never hide. No llama.cpp, no Ollama removal, no
  memory/projects/storage changes. New suites
  `tests/test_provider_status.py` / `tests/test_provider_endpoints.py`;
  see [`docs/model-providers.md`](docs/model-providers.md).
- Model provider in Settings → Models (Phase 1 UI, read-only,
  admin-only): the active model provider is now visible and testable
  where users actually look for model settings, not just in the deep
  Admin → Provider tab. The status snapshot now also reports Nova's
  default chat model (`config.MODELS["default"]` — host-level,
  non-secret; a missing default degrades to `""`, never an error) and
  whether the resolved backend supports streaming. A new admin-only
  card in **Settings → Models** shows the active provider and its
  state, the current/default model, the streaming flag, the redacted
  Ollama host, and a **Test connection** button with a clear
  success/failure message; the row is hidden entirely for non-admins
  and the endpoints stay `require_admin`. Reuses the existing
  `/admin/provider/status` and `/admin/provider/test-connection`
  endpoints — nothing new is written, pulled, restarted, or
  generated, Ollama stays the default, and `MockProvider` stays
  test-only. No new runtime, no model downloads, no cloud provider,
  no API keys; chat/memory/projects/storage behaviour is unchanged.
- Model-provider abstraction (Phase: provider abstraction only): Nova
  is no longer architecturally hardwired to Ollama. A new
  `core/model_providers` package introduces a backend-agnostic
  `ModelProvider` interface (`ModelRequest` / `ModelResponse` /
  `ModelChunk` / `ProviderHealth` / `ModelProviderError`), a registry,
  and an `OllamaProvider` that preserves the existing Ollama request,
  streaming, fallback, and unreachable-error behaviour exactly. The
  `chat` / `chat_stream` paths now talk to the provider interface
  instead of calling the Ollama client directly; the Ollama-specific
  stream duck-typing moved behind the provider. A deterministic
  `MockProvider` replaces ad-hoc client stubs in tests. **Ollama
  remains the default and fully supported** (`NOVA_MODEL_PROVIDER`,
  default `ollama`); future *local* runtimes (llama.cpp, transformers,
  a Nova-owned runtime) can register cleanly. No new runtime, no model
  downloads, no shell/Docker/cloud/API-key, and no settings migration
  in this phase. Nova identity / context / memory / safety stay owned
  by Nova and always above any provider. See
  [`docs/model-providers.md`](docs/model-providers.md).
- Nova Projects / Workspaces (Phase 1): a local-first, per-user
  foundation for organising conversations and memory by project (e.g.
  `Nova`, `Auryn`, `SilentGuard`, `Home Lab`, `Personal`). Adds an
  additive `projects` table and a nullable `project_id` column on
  `conversations`, `memories`, and `natural_memories` — all idempotent,
  with **no backfill and no reclassification**: existing conversations
  and memory stay "General" / global and behave exactly as before.
  Memory is now scoped: a General chat sees global memory only; a
  project chat sees global memory **plus** that project's memory and
  never another project's. Project context is contextual user data and
  is injected **below** the identity/safety contract, so it can never
  override safety, identity, auth, or admin rules. New endpoints
  (`GET/POST /projects`, `PATCH /projects/{id}`,
  `POST /projects/{id}/archive|unarchive`); `/conversations` is
  filterable by `?scope=general` / `?project_id=`; `/conversations`,
  `/chat`, and `/chat/stream` accept an optional `project_id` for new
  conversations. Archiving is a soft, reversible, non-destructive flag —
  there are no destructive project deletes. The sidebar gains a small
  `General + projects` selector; the rest of the UI is unchanged.
  Storage/migration, export/restore, and Ollama behaviour are
  untouched. See [`docs/projects.md`](docs/projects.md).
- Safe guided restore for Nova data export packages (Storage &
  Migration Phase 3). The Storage tab now exposes a four-step flow —
  inspect, dry-run, confirm, restore — backed by a new
  `apply_restore` helper in `core/data_export.py`, two admin
  endpoints (`POST /admin/storage/restore-dry-run` and
  `POST /admin/storage/restore`), and a `python -m core.data_export
  restore <archive> --confirm` CLI subcommand. Every real restore
  writes an automatic pre-restore backup of the current data under
  `NOVA_DATA_DIR/backups/pre-restore/`, refuses to proceed if the
  backup cannot be written, stages the archive into a private
  `.restore-staging/` directory inside the data root, validates
  every extracted member against path traversal / symlink escape,
  and only then replaces files atomically per-file. Failed restores
  leave existing data bit-for-bit identical; the pre-restore backup
  is preserved on success so an operator can roll back. The admin UI
  keeps the restore button disabled until inspection and dry-run
  both succeed and the operator ticks an explicit "I understand"
  checkbox. No cloud sync, no automatic restart, no shell, no model
  files; secrets, `.env`, `.git`, and Ollama models stay out by
  construction. See `docs/storage-and-migration.md` for the full
  walkthrough.
- Smoother streamed chat experience: the streaming bubble now coalesces
  incoming Ollama tokens on a short flush window (~28 ms) and only
  paints once per cycle, so single-character chunks no longer cause
  visible jitter. The final Markdown is still rendered once, on the
  `done` event, so half-formed code fences never flicker into the
  wrong layout. The endpoint still forwards every Ollama chunk as its
  own NDJSON `delta` event; coalescing lives in the renderer.
- `expressive` emoji preference level. A fourth choice in Settings →
  Personalization → Emoji level lets users opt into a slightly warmer
  feel in casual chat (one or two emojis per reply, never in clusters).
  Code, PR, documentation, and security replies stay sober regardless
  — that rule is restated in the prompt, not left to the model.
- Calmer / more human style guidance in the system prompt. The
  RESPONSE_STYLE_BLOCK now includes explicit TON / PERTINENCE /
  HONNÊTETÉ guidance: acknowledge intent briefly, stay project-focused
  on Nova / SilentGuard / PR / security questions, be honest about
  limits, and never claim to feel emotions or be conscious. The Nova
  Safety and Trust Contract still wins — the new lines are a tone
  reminder, not a new capability.
- Edit and delete sent chat messages from the chat UI (issue #94). Two
  new auth-gated endpoints, `PUT /messages/{id}` and
  `DELETE /messages/{id}`, accept content edits and message deletes
  scoped to the caller's conversations. Cross-user requests return 404
  to avoid leaking existence. Deleting a user message can optionally
  remove the paired assistant reply by passing
  `?cascade_assistant=true`; assistant deletes never cascade. Editing
  rewrites the message in place — it does not regenerate Nova's reply
  (regenerate-after-edit is left as an explicit follow-up). Memory
  entries are deliberately untouched: editing or deleting a chat
  message never removes memories already extracted from it. Feedback
  rows attached to a deleted message id are cleaned up so the local
  feedback table never carries dangling references. The chat-stream
  `done` event now also surfaces `user_message_id` so the browser can
  attach edit/delete controls to the just-sent user bubble without a
  conversation reload.
- Read-only GitHub maintainer triage helper (issue #119 follow-up).
  A new admin-only endpoint, `GET /integrations/github/recommendations`,
  surfaces a short ranked list of open issues a maintainer might want
  to work on next, with `difficulty`, `priority_reason`,
  `recommended_next_step`, `risk_notes`, and `confidence` fields per
  entry. Ranking is deterministic and label-driven — there is no LLM
  call, no background polling, and no GitHub mutation. Optional query
  params: `repo`, `label`, `difficulty`, `topic`, `limit`. The
  underlying connector stays strictly read-only; the configured token
  is never echoed back in the response.
- Local response feedback turns thumbs up / thumbs down into a per-user
  preference signal. Ratings are stored locally in SQLite (scoped per
  user, never sent off-host), and a short, deterministic preference
  block is appended to future system prompts below the identity
  contract and the personalization block. Thumbs-down accepts an
  optional short reason; reasons that look like they contain a
  credential are refused at write time. Ratings can be listed and
  deleted via `GET /feedback` and `DELETE /feedback/{id}`.

### Fixed
- Streaming chat: empty model output no longer leaves a stray empty
  Nova bubble in the transcript or persists a blank assistant row.
  The `/chat/stream` endpoint now surfaces an `error` event when the
  reply is empty or whitespace-only, and the frontend renders a calm
  fallback message instead of an unanswered bubble. Reloading a
  conversation no longer shows duplicate or empty assistant rows.
